Hi, everyone! My name is Lewis and I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm a self-taught web developer and I'm writing this blog to learn in public as I work towards getting my first job in the industry. If you want to see how it's built, you can [check out the repo here](https://github.com/kindoflew/idkwid).

These posts are going to be focused on front-end development using JavaScript frameworks -- targeted at self-taught developers or those who know the basics, but are looking for more mid-level content (so basically me, I guess). 

I'm going to talk about Svelte a lot, since it's my favorite and it rules. I've also recently become a maintainer of [@react-spring/parallax](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) so expect at least a few posts about me trying to figure out whatever the hell is going on in React.

*As I mentioned above, I'm currently looking for a full-time developer position. If you or someone you know is hiring for associate/junior front-end devs -- feel free to get in touch on Twitter: [@kindoflew](https://twitter.com/kindoflew).*
